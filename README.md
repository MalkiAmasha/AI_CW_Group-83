# Scenario overview 👩‍💻

As people increasingly use digital devices like smartphones and smartwatches to access sensitive information, 
such as online payments and banking, it's crucial to have an enhanced authentication method that continuously 
and transparently safeguards user data from unauthorized access. This assessment seeks to evaluate 
acceleration-based features and explore their potential for verifying user identity through neural networks. For  
this task, you are required to:

• Perform an analysis of the given data to better understand the inter and intra variance (descriptive 
statistics)  
• Using appropriate configured Feedforward Multi-Layer Perceptron (feedforwardnet) to train and 
evaluate the dataset.  
• Optimize the performance using any combination of feature selection and classifier.
